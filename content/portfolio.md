## Who am I?

I'm Tyrone Huang, a 3rd Year UTS student studying I.T and International Studies. I'm majoring in Interaction Design, with a submajor in Enterprise Systems Development. I pushed myself to take this Summer Studio relating to Cyber Security to expand my horizons outside of programming subjects, and to test the waters in which career path I would like to take in the future!

## SLO 1 - Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem
#### “The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.” Sun Tzu

In the second week of this Summer Studio, guest speaker Robert Mitchell ended his presentation with this quote. This quote about war, while from a man who has been long dead for over 2000 years, could be used to summate the experience of a Cybersecurity analyst in the modern age. Though the quote mentions a 'position that is unassailable', it alludes to the opposite - to the problem idea that most positions, and most systems, are in fact 'assailable', or 'crackable'.

Prior to beginning this Summer Studio, I always had a slight prejudice - that 'hacking' or cyber attacks were purely malicious acts, that trying to recover or prevent these attacks was lawful. Yet upon understanding the concept of 'pentesting', and hearing the testimonials of experts such as Robert Mitchell or Pieter and Nathan from Deloitte, I begin to realise that lawful individuals (such as Cybersecurity analysts) can indeed use what might be the 'evil' act of hacking for good.

In relation to that, my biggest shock from Pieter and Nathan's presentation was of how many avenues of attack they used on their own system. The mentioned of three parts of Cybersecurity - Physical (cameras, doors), Social (social engineering) and Cyber (actual 'hacking'). Each day, they devise new ways to break into their own systems through any means possible - because it is possible, one way or another. And they just need to find out how and why.

The problem, I've found after listening to all these experts - is the extricable link between red teamers who 'attack', and blue teamers who 'defend', in creating something that is secure and 'impregnable.' There is no denying the significance of an 'Offensive Mindset' in cybersecurity when attempting to create something impregnable and secure.

## SLO 2 - Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem
My understanding of challenges and ways to tackle them changed greatly throughout the course of this subject. Each week, my understanding of how the pentesting process changed slightly as I was exposed to pentesting slowly, learning firstly unix commands from Bandit and Natas, of Web Vulnerabilities from OWASP, until I became familiar with tackling CTF challenges from TryHackMe and HackTheBox.

The more I was exposed to, the greater the complexities grew, and the research I needed to complete each step increased exponentially. What began at straightforward as entering a system with a provided password, and learning the 'ssh' command in bandit lvl 1, soon became an interation through the greater structure of pentesting as a whole:
