## Who am I?
I'm Tyrone Huang, a 3rd Year UTS student studying I.T and International Studies. 

I'm majoring in Interaction Design, with a submajor in Enterprise Systems Development. These majors meant I trudged through uni doing a ton of coding assignments. It wasnt always fun or particularly interesting for me, and my motivation dipped further and further through the years.

### I started wondering - 
Do I really want to be a programmer? What else is out there in I.T? If I had time and effort to spare, it might not be wasted branching out. Maybe I could feel out something else I might like while I was still in uni. Which led to me picking up Networking/Cybersecurity as a submajor. I've found it quite practical and interesting, if not also challenging.

In the Summer of 2020 I picked up the Cybersecurity Summer Studio. My thoughts and journey through this studio will be recorded in this blog, alongside my accomplishments and difficulties. By the end of this studio -

#### I hope to gain enough knowledge to concretely say: I wouldn't mind continuing pursuing this in the future, as a serious career path! 
#### Or conversely: enough confidence to know that I've tried my best, but this isn't my cup of tea.

To that end, I'm aiming to learn as much about this field and acquire an adequate volume of technical and general knowledge. Throughout this studio I want to engage with games I've never tried before, and learn about attacks, vulnerabilities and think outside of a layman's perspective. By learning as much as I can - and acquiring an adequate volume of technical and general knowledge, I'll be on the right track to study for certificates such as OSCP. 

And from then on, I'll be at a good point to decide my future path.
#### Oh and by the way? The ‘Yellow’ theme of this blog has a reason.
It's connected to my last name, which is Huang 黄, or Yellow in Chinese! 

Happily, Yellow is one of my favourite colours too and you can catch me wearing it all the time.
