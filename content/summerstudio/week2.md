## Sprint 2: Presentations and lots of learning!

Compared to last week, when I was overwhelmed from exposure to everything for the first time, this week I’ve been able to expand my basic knowledge about this field and develop an idea of what cybersecurity looks like.

This week involved:
+ Guest speakers who provided valuable insights about their tools and their work
+ Performed a group presentation detailing the Nikto Tool
+ Began to learn via hacking wargames website: OverTheWire.

### Guest Speakers
#### Linux
Patrick came in on Tuesday 28/01 and discussed Linux: how he used it, and how it was used in the industry (i.e primarily Redhat Linux). He spoke with much passion of the capabilities and flexibility of customisation for Linux, and how it was viable not only for work but also at home. He recommended using Linux as our primary OS, and to paraphrse him greatly, we would learn through trial by fire by troubleshooting all the issues we would run into. 

This mode of action really was something that struck me - jumping into the deep end and learning Linux is something I can play around with at anytime. I'd always thought of it as something I would only try when I'm thinking about job hunting and tailoring skills for a specific job role. 

Beyond what I learnt in a single core I.T subject in 2017, I currently have little understanding of how Linux works. Committing to an entirely different OS would be a terrifying and frustrating experience at this stage, but thanks to Patrick I've been pointed in the right direction towards all the resources I need. But if my interests and curiousity line up here, I could start this now. This kind of thing is definitely the best way to learn the most that you can, I just have to start.


#### Hacking through the years
Robert Mitchell came in on Thursday 30/01, and gave much historical context and real world perspective on the cybersecurity field.
Particularly poignant was his story about handling Heartbleed, which had the potential to ‘break the internet’ and was effectively an emergency situation. His experiences in staying overnight and attending long, long meetings in order to discuss a response, allowed me to imagine what the most desperate moments of a job in I.T security might look like.

Though the example I gave might be a bit of a grand outlier, I feel like Robert's talk gave me something to imagine: an endgame of sorts to all this studying, and a glimpse of what to expect in the industry. After his talk, my classmates asked a lot of good questions on what we as students could focus on and what to build and tailor our resumes towards.

I really enjoyed hearing all these new perspectives, but at the time I had no idea what to even ask. I felt a bit frustrated not knowing what I didn't know, which at this stage admittedly is 'everything'. If I had even just a little bit more basic knowledge about I.T security, I could take advantage of the resources and people I'm given. I hope to build up my knowledge and revise this thought weekly until the end of this studio. But after these talks, I can say that I have at least a general idea :)

### Group Presentation
I presented as a group on a cybersecurity tool named Nikto, alongside 3 groupmates. The presentation itself went smoothly, and the slides were done quite nicely thanks to formatting by group member Manish.

On Tuesday 28/01, we assigned ourselves into our groups, decided on our tool and tentatively planned out our workflow. I recorded this as minutes in a Google Doc and shared onto the Teams app.

While the presentation was smooth on the most part, there are things I would do better as a team and for myself.

1. We failed to open discussion about a time to finish all our parts and a time to practice. We all ended up finishing at separate times, some of us late at night. This meant it was impossible to view a completed presentation and practice until Thursday morning - right before our class.

##### Above: Google teams chat with timestamps ranging from 7pm to 8:30pm, and nothing until 9am

2. We decided that each of our four group members would cover one point about the tool. We did not count on some of our points overlapping. This was brought to head especially during my research of 'What Information does it gather?', overlapping with the next point 'How can the information you gather be used?' - and this overlap caused some brief repetition during our presentation

For a future group project, I would like for the group and myself to be more organised and accountable for time. Perhaps using an management tool such as Trello or Google Teams could achieve this goal. Given this accountability, our group would have the time and flexibility to deal with overlapping/clashing parts, and finalise preparation for the project.


### Learning through Wargames
From Thursday 28/01 onwards, we were given time and freedom to learn at our discretion, but most of us in the class were guided towards the wargames at Overthewire.org. I initially had trouble just beating the easy level of Level 0 (I was so confused how to input username and password) , but thanks to help from my tutor Max, I was able to pass it. Thankfully I learned exponentially from there.

##### Above: Success!!!
I worked diligently from Level 1-9 on Thursday, but busied myself with other commitments over the weekend and did not achieve the level of 20 that was recommended for me to achieve, and which I had thought to beat myself. 

#### From this week onwards, my problem lies in self-motivation 
I realised that my problem lies in self-motivation, and though I am hearing and seeing a lot while I am new to this field, I have not done enough in my own time to advance my knowledge and skills. Especially for my self-goals for Bandit on Overthewire.org, I've been leaving it as a chunk to do at the end of the week. As with my blog, I should be constantly doing sizable amounts each day, such that I build a schedule, and avoid procrastination. 

Similarly for future group projects, if I begin and consistently work on my part early, I would be able to catch problems for our group before they arise. I would then have time to account for the natural delays and problems that arise suddenly in a group environment.
