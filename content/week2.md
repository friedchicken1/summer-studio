## Sprint 2: Presentations and lots of learning!

Compared to last week, when I was overwhelmed from exposure to everything for the first time, this week I’ve been able to expand my basic knowledge about this field and develop an idea of what cybersecurity looks like.

This week involved:
+ Guest speakers who provided valuable insights about their tools and their work
+ Performed a group presentation detailing the Nikto Tool
+ Began to learn via hacking wargames website: OverTheWire.

### Guest Speakers
#### Linux
Patrick came in on Tuesday 28/01 and discussed Linux: how he used it, and how it was used in the industry (i.e primarily Redhat Linux). He spoke with much passion of the capabilities and flexibility of customisation for Linux, and how it was viable not only for work but also at home. He recommended using Linux as our primary OS, and of learning through trial by fire by troubleshooting all the issues we would run into. 

This mode of action really was something that struck me - jumping into the deep end and learning Linux is something I can play around with at anytime. I'd always thought of it as something I would only try when I'm thinking about job hunting and tailoring skills for a specific job role. But if my interests and curiousity line up here, I could start this now.

Beyond what I learnt in a single core I.T subject in 2017, I currently have little understanding of how Linux works. Committing to an entirely different OS would be a terrifying and frustrating experience at this stage, but it's something I need to hear or else I'd never try. It's definitely the best way to learn the most that I can.

#### Hacking through the years
Robert Mitchell came in on Thursday 30/01, and gave much historical context and real world perspective on the cybersecurity field.
Particularly poignant was his story about handling Heartbleed, which had the potential to ‘break the internet’ and was effectively an emergency situation. His experiences in staying overnight and attending long, long meetings in order to discuss a response, allowed me to imagine what the most desperate moments of a job in I.T security might look like.

Though the example I gave might be a bit of a grand outlier, I feel like Robert's talk gave me something to imagine: an endgame of sorts to all this studying, and a glimpse of what to expect in the industry. After his talk, my classmates asked a lot of good questions on what we as students could focus on and what to build and tailor our resumes towards.

I really enjoyed hearing all these new perspectives, but at the time I had no idea what to even ask. I felt a bit frustrated not knowing what I didn't know, which at this stage admittedly is 'everything'. If I had even just a little bit more basic knowledge about I.T security, I could take advantage of the resources and people I'm given. I hope to build up my knowledge and revise this thought weekly until the end of this studio. But after these talks, I can say that I have at least a general idea :)

### Group Presentation
I presented as a group on a cybersecurity tool named Nikto, alongside 3 groupmates. The presentation itself went smoothly, and the slides were done quite nicely thanks to formatting by group member Manish.

There however were a few bumps in the road, and there are things I would do better as a team and for myself.

##### Above: Minutes I recorded on Tuesday

On Tuesday 28/01, we assigned ourselves into our groups, decided on our tool and tentatively planned out our timeline - which I recorded as minutes in a Google Doc and shared onto the Teams app.

### Learning through Wargames
As with working with anything I.T related for the first time, there were many things to install before I could even begin on my actual work and blog content. This affected my time man
