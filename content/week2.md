## Sprint 2: Presentations and lots of learning!

Compared to last week, where I was overwhelmed from exposure to everything for the first time, this week I’ve been able to expand my basic knowledge about this field and develop a basic idea of what cybersecurity is.

This week, I was introduced:
Guest speakers who provided valuable insights about their tools and their work
Performed a group presentation after researching about a cybersecurity tool
Began to learn via hacking wargames website: OverTheWire.

### Guest Speakers
#### Linux
Patrick came in on Tuesday and discussed Linux: how he used it, and how it was used in the industry (i.e primarily Redhat Linux). He spoke with much passion and gave me the impression that Linux was viable not only for work but also at home, especially in discussion about using Linux on personal machines, and in the fun of customisation. He recommended using Linux as our primary OS, and though we would without a doubt run into unknown issues, we would be able to learn much about the system through constant troubleshooting.

That really was something that struck me - jumping into the deep end and learning Linux doesnt have to start when I'm looking for a job in the industry, but could be something I play around with and try now. 

Beyond what I learnt in a single core I.T subject in 2017, I currently have little understanding of how Linux works. Committing to an entirely different OS would be a terrifying and frustrating experience at this stage, but it's something I need to hear or else I'd never try. It's definitely the best way to learn the most that I can.

#### Hacking through the years
Robert Mitchell came in on Thursday, and gave much historical context and real world perspective on the cybersecurity field.
Particularly poignant was his story about handling Heartbleed, which had the potential to ‘break the internet’ and was effectively an emergency situation. His experiences in staying overnight and attending long, long meetings in order to discuss a response, allowed me to imagine what the most desperate moments of a job in I.T security might look like.

Though the example I gave might be a bit of a grand outlier, I feel like Robert's talk gave me a lot of understanding on the endgame of all this studying - of what actually to expect in the industry. My classmates asked a lot of good questions, especially what us students should be focusing on for now, and what to build on our resumes to be attractive for companies and recruiters.

But for me, I had no idea what to even ask in the first place. I feel a bit frustrating not know what I don't know, which at this stage admittedly is 'everything'. If I had even just a little bit more basic knowledge about I.T security, I could take advantage of the resources and people I'm given. I hope to build up my knowledge and revise this thought weekly until the end of this studio.

### Group Presentation
I presented on a cybersecurity tool named Nikto, alongside 3 other groupmates. The presentation itself went smoothly, and the slides were done quite nicely thanks to slide formatting by group member Manish.




### Learning through Wargames
As with working with anything I.T related for the first time, there were many things to install before I could even begin on my actual work and blog content. This affected my time man
