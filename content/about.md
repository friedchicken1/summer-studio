## Who am I?
I'm Tyrone Huang, a 3rd Year UTS student studying I.T and International Studies. 

I'm majoring in Interaction Design, with a submajor in Enterprise Systems Development. These majors meant I trudged through uni doing a ton of coding assignments. It wasnt always fun or particularly interesting for me, and my motivation dipped further and further through the years.

### I started wondering - 
Do I really want to be a programmer? What else is out there in I.T? If I had time and effort to spare, it might not be wasted branching out. Maybe I could feel out something else I might like while I was still in uni.

I picked up Networking/Cybersecurity as a submajor - which I admittedly also don't know anything about at the time.

So far, I've been finding it quite practical and interesting, if not also challenging. I'm still on my journey, and in the Summer of 2020 I eventually picked up the Cybersecurity Summer Studio. 

My thoughts and journey will be recorded in this blog, with all of my accomplishments and difficulties. By the end of this studio -

#### I hope to gain enough knowledge to concretely say - I love the field of Cybersecurity/I have enough confidence to know that I don't want to continue this field in the future! 

To that end, I'm aiming to learn as much about this field - about attacks, vulnerabilities, to struggle with games and much more that I can't even understand at this time. 

#### By the way? The ‘Yellow’ theme of this blog has a reason.
It's connected to my last name, which is Huang 黄, or Yellow in Chinese! Happily, Yellow is one of my favourite colours too.
