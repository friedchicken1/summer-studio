## The 'Yellow' theme of this blog has a reason.

It's connected to my last name, which is Huang - meaning Yellow in Chinese. 

Coincidentally, yellow is also one of my favourite colours - and I'm wearing one of my favourite yellow shirts here!

My Chinese name (which I unforunately never really use) is 黄天龙 (huang tian long, or 'Yellow Sky Dragon). An awesome name if I would say so myself, if not also really childish to say out loud! 

###### The 'Sky Dragon' component of my name is also included in themes in this blog :)
