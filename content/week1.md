## Creating a Blog
In this week of the Cybersecurity Summer Studio, I was tasked with creating a blog to record our reflections and observations in the upcoming weeks.

This blog was required to cooperate with several Subject Learning Objectives (SLOs) - basically I have to report about specific experiences and achievements.

#### This blog should engage with stakeholders


Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem
-This means breaking down the concepts and tasks I write about into laymans terms, and demonstrating my own knowledge of the topic in succinct summary. 
As of right now, I'm still at that layman's level of knowledge of cybersecurity and 'breaking into websites'. I would be quite lost, but I plan to work on a few games that have been recommended to me.
