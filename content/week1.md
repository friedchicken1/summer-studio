## Creating a Blog
In this first week of the Cybersecurity Summer Studio, I was tasked with creating a blog to record my thoughts and reflections for the following weeks.

I'd never created a blog before, and I was incredibly lost in what this involved, and even where to even start. I had no choice but to blindly follow the resources linked by my helpful tutors in Microsoft teams, and to frantically google and ask around when things simply didn't work out.

### Thinking about Installation
As with working with any new languages or programs, there were many things to install before I could even begin on my actual work and blog content. For this blog, I setup:

- Hugo (a static site generator that uses markdown syntax)

- a Github repo (to store the files that constituted the webpages of my blog)

- Netlify (to link create a site based on my Github repository)

- a Namecheap Domain (free from Github Education pack)

This blog was required to cooperate with several Subject Learning Objectives (SLOs) - basically I have to report about specific experiences and achievements.

#### This blog should engage with stakeholders


Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem
-This means breaking down the concepts and tasks I write about into laymans terms, and demonstrating my own knowledge of the topic in succinct summary. 
As of right now, I'm still at that layman's level of knowledge of cybersecurity and 'breaking into websites'. I would be quite lost, but I plan to work on a few games that have been recommended to me.
