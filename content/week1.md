## Creating a Blog
In this first week of the Cybersecurity Summer Studio, I was tasked with creating a blog to record my thoughts and reflections for the following weeks.

I'd never created a blog before, and I was incredibly lost in what this involved, and even where to even start. I had no choice but to blindly follow the resources linked by my helpful tutors in Microsoft teams, and to frantically google and ask around when things simply didn't work out.

### Thinking about Installation
As with working with any new languages or programs, there were many things to install before I could even begin on my actual work and blog content. For this blog, I setup:

- Hugo (a static site generator that uses markdown syntax)

- Chocolatey (a package manager that I used to install Hugo)

- a Github repo (to store the files that constituted the webpages of my blog)

- Netlify (create a site based on my Github repository)

- a Namecheap Domain (free from Github Education pack)

But how did it all come together? I had to ask my tutor, Jason Ko - who brought me to the whiteboard and explained the whole process.

He explained that all these things I'd had to setup were connected - in order to build and deploy this static site. 

The structure and look of the site would be built using Hugo, my files would be stored online in a Github repo, and this repo would be used by Netlify to create a site. This site wouldn't be publicly available until I setup a custom domain - to that end I acquired a domain name from Namecheap. 

Everything was so much clearer after understanding this framework. After this, I was able to fearlessly get to work on correctly setting up everything I needed.

### Unexpected Problems
For the most part of my setup, I was following a Step by Step guide the whole way, until it didn't.

#### This blog should engage with stakeholders


Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem
-This means breaking down the concepts and tasks I write about into laymans terms, and demonstrating my own knowledge of the topic in succinct summary. 
As of right now, I'm still at that layman's level of knowledge of cybersecurity and 'breaking into websites'. I would be quite lost, but I plan to work on a few games that have been recommended to me.
