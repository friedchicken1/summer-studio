<p>This writeup is still a work in progress. I’ve spent daily sessions of 2-3 hours.(including procrastination) for 3 days with my friend and classmate Dylan Tchan working through this box. We both are relatively new to pentesting and are going through everything for almost the first time.</p>
<p>As of now, we have yet to complete this box, but we aim to complete it soon!</p>
<h2 id="this-challenge-may-be-found-herehttpstryhackmecomroombiohazard">This challenge may be found <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/biohazard#">here</a></h2>
<h4 id="note-ip-addresses-in-the-url-may-change-as-the-box-was-redeployed-several-times-throughout-the-course-of-this-writeup">Note: Ip Addresses in the URL may change, as the box was redeployed several times throughout the course of this writeup</h4>
<p>Starting from the Biohazard webpage on TryHackMe.com, I joined the room, initiated TryHackMe’s OpenVpn and deployed the box.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/nmap.png" alt="alt text">
Starting off by using an nmap scan, I was able to find 3 open ports. Port 80 was open: a port normally reserved for HTTP communication. This suggested that I could run the challenge normally through visiting the website’s HTML webpage.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/front.png" alt="alt text">
The first page contained the team name: of Stars Alpha team, and a hyperlink to the next page, /mansionmain/.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/mansion.png" alt="alt text">
There is nothing apparent upon entering the Mansion, but upon inspecting source code, I found a comment stating the next room was the /diningRoom/
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/dining.png" alt="alt text">
Within the Dining room, a hyperlink provided me with an emblem: emblem{fec832623ea498e20bf4fe1821d58727}
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/emblem.png" alt="alt text"><br>
A form input appeared, but inputting the emblem did not work as of yet. There was nothing apparent to use this for at this time, so I saved this for future use.
After checking source code in /diningRoom/, I found a comment which I decoded using the website CyberChef, from Base 64.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/dinehint.png" alt="alt text">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/dinehintde.png" alt="alt text">
The decoded output directed me to the /tearoom/, where apparently ‘The nightmare begin’
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/lock.png" alt="alt text">
This room contained yet another hyperlink, which provided me with a lockpick:
lock_pick{037b35e2ff90916a9abf99129c8e1837}</p>
<p>Again, not sure what to do with this at this time but I kept this information. I moved onto the art room as the text suggested me to do.
The art room contained a hyperlink to a page with a list of rooms, called a ‘maproom’.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/map.png" alt="alt text">
This was essentially a directory pointing to a bunch of new rooms which I would explore from here out. I began with the barRoom, which was next on the link. 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/bar.png" alt="alt text">
A ‘piano’ is contained in this page, which requires some sort of flag I have obtained.
Underneath this input, is a hyperlink which provides a music note.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/barnote.png" alt="alt text">
Putting this through a base 32 decoder provided me with a music sheet flag
music_sheet{362d72deaf65f5bdc63daece6a1f676e}
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/barnoteen.png" alt="alt text">
I put this music sheet into the piano input, which directed me to a /secretBarRoom/
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/secretbar.png" alt="alt text">
This secret bar room contained a hyperlink providing a gold emblem.
gold_emblem{58a8c41a9d08b8a4e38d02a4d7ff4843}
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/goldemblem.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>I inputted the original emblem that I retained from the dining room into the new input that appeared on this page, which gave me ‘rebecca’.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/rebecca.png" alt="alt text">
I initially assumed this was a ‘user’, and saved it for future use.
As the original emblem I just used came from the dining room, vice versa, I assumed the gold emblem I had just received from the secret bar room could be used back there.
Inputting the gold emblem into the diningRoom form, I received a jumble of words. klfvg ks r wimgnd biz mpuiui ulg fiemok tqod. Xii jvmc tbkg ks tempgf tyi_hvgct_jljinf_kvc
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/diningemblem.png" alt="alt text">
After some trial and error, I placed this into the Cyberchef websites as a vigenere cipher, using Rebecca as a key. The key required only letters, and the jumble of letters was already contained within the input, so this was what I found to be successful.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/shieldde.png" alt="alt text">
The output suggested that I should add the_great_shield_key to the url back in the diningRoom, which provided me with the shield_key. This would be used later for rooms requiring said key.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/shieldkey.png" alt="alt text">
I continued down the list to diningRoom2f, which contained no hyperlinks. 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/dining2f.png" alt="alt text">
However, upon inspecting element I found a comment.
This took a great while of trial and error, but I was able to decode it from rot13. Apparently the gem could be find by appending /sapphire to the diningRoom url:
blue_jewel{e1d457e96cac640f863ec7bc475d48aa}
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friedchicken1/summer-studio/master/data/img/writeup/bluejewel.png" alt="alt text">
This would be used in the subsequent Tiger statue room</p>
<p>Entering the Gallery room and checking out its hyperlink revealed the next stage of this challenge. I was to find 4 crests in total, with the second provided here.
The criteria of solving this crest was that I had to decode it twice, and the output was of length 18 characters.</p>
<p>Through extensive trial and error with Cyberchef, I found that it was to be decoded from base 32 and then base 58: 
h1bnRlciwgRlRQIHBh -crest 2
I saved this and set out to get other crests.</p>
<p>The Attic
Using the shield key from earlier, I was able to enter this room.
This contained a hyperlink which lead to crest 4. It appeared that this had no criteria to decode unlike crest 2.</p>
<p>gSUERauVpvKzRpyPpuYz66JDmRTbJubaoArM6CAQsnVwte6zF9J4GGYyun3k5qM9ma4s</p>
<p>Armour Room
Similarly to the attic, I was able to use the shield key and enter this room. This room contained a hyperlink which led to crest 3, which was to be decoded thrice.</p>

Last week, I'd vowed to be more consistent with my work, and to catchup with Bandit and Natas in any spare time that I had. This week, I was able to fit in a little more consistency with my work, and found that I really had my hands full with pentesting.</p>
