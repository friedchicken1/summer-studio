<h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>
<p>I'm Tyrone Huang, a 3rd Year UTS student studying I.T and International Studies.</p>
<p>I'm majoring in Interaction Design, with a submajor in Enterprise Systems Development. These majors meant I trudged through uni doing a ton of coding assignments. It wasnt always fun or particularly interesting for me, and my motivation dipped further and further through the years.</p>
<h3 id="i-started-wondering--">I started wondering -</h3>
<p>Do I really want to be a programmer? What else is out there in I.T? If I had time and effort to spare, it might not be wasted branching out. Maybe I could feel out something else I might like while I was still in uni. Which led to me picking up Networking/Cybersecurity as a submajor. I've found it quite practical and interesting, if not also challenging.</p>
<p>In the Summer of 2020 I picked up the Cybersecurity Summer Studio. My thoughts and journey through this studio will be recorded in this blog, alongside my accomplishments and difficulties. By the end of this studio -</p>
<h4 id="i-hope-to-gain-enough-knowledge-to-concretely-say-i-wouldnt-mind-continuing-pursuing-this-in-the-future-as-a-serious-career-path">I hope to gain enough knowledge to concretely say: I wouldn't mind continuing pursuing this in the future, as a serious career path!</h4>
<h4 id="or-conversely-enough-confidence-to-know-that-ive-tried-my-best-but-this-isnt-my-cup-of-tea">Or conversely: enough confidence to know that I've tried my best, but this isn't my cup of tea.</h4>
<p>To that end, I'm aiming to learn as much about this field and acquire an adequate volume of technical and general knowledge. Throughout this studio I want to engage with games I've never tried before, and learn about attacks, vulnerabilities and think outside of a layman's perspective. By learning as much as I can - and acquiring an adequate volume of technical and general knowledge, I'll be on the right track to study for certificates such as OSCP.</p>
<p>And from then on, I'll be at a good point to decide my future path.</p>
<h4 id="oh-and-by-the-way-the-yellow-theme-of-this-blog-has-a-reason">Oh and by the way? The ‘Yellow’ theme of this blog has a reason.</h4>
<p>It's connected to my last name, which is Huang 黄, or Yellow in Chinese!</p>
<p>Happily, Yellow is one of my favourite colours too and you can catch me wearing it all the time.</p>
